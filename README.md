# Branding Myself
![](https://github.com/FuAdventure/Brand-Yourself/raw/master/Me.PNG)

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, developing point-of-care diagnostic systems. Besides my study interests (bioinstrument, data science, business, etc.), I also have a wide range of hobbies, such as reading, traveling, playing flute, dancing and gardening. 

## Self Analysis
I'm actually a fan of personality analysis and have completed many tests. For example, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), my personality type is ENTJ (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging), the Commander type. It's said that Commanders are natural-born leaders and contribute to about 2~3% of total population. (I'm honered to fall in the same category as Steve Jobs!) From self analysis, I listed some of my top strengths and weaknesses.
### Strengths
##### Strength One: A fast and happy learner
I don't need emphasize on my love of learning since I have already been in school for so many years. I'm curious and would like to learn about so many things. In most cases, I can learn whatever that can be taught. I'd like to be a Renaissance person and Leonardo da Vinci is one of my idols.
##### Strength Two: Ambitious
I once encounted a quote from Arnold Beckman that engraved on the wall of the Beckman Institute on our campus, "There is no satisfactory substitute for excellence". I resonate with it very much. For me, the greatest happiness is from making achivements, not from entertainment. I guess I love learning partly because it makes me more powerful in solving problems and achieving my goals.
##### Strength Three: Reliable 
My teammates can count on me as the last one to keep tackling hard problems. I can keep secrets shared with me and give a helping hand to my friends and strangers who are struggling or suffering.
### Weaknesses
##### Weakness One: Not a networker
I have a tendency to avoid gatherings or parties that usually involve a lot of small talk, gossiping and other conversations that seem boring to me. I enjoy intellectually stimulating interactions with people though. I'm not that type of people who can keep hundreds of contacts and always would like to meet more.
##### Weakness Two: Lacking self-discipline sometimes
Provided that I have short-term and long-term goals, sometimes I'm still distracted to other activities that will not help me at least in the near future. For instance, I can overeat my favorite food even if I have set a goal of losing weight. Procrastination before deadlines of tasks that I dislike is another example.
##### Weakness Three: Lacking big pictures sometimes
I'm striving to perform current work as best as I can, which may lead to too much focus on the present and not enough thinking for the whole picture and the future.

## External Analysis & Congruence Analysis
##### Top strengths: Warm-hearted/Compassionate, Responsible/Reliable, Smart, Knowledgeble, Persevere, Planning & Organization
##### Top weaknesses: Taking too much on my plate, Not social enough, Intolerate/Impatient, Too Rational (in some aspects), Stubborn
Based on my survey with 12 of my family members, friends and colleagues, we generally agree on the strengths that I found on myself (actually they listed more). One interesting finding is that while I measure myself primariy on the achievement scale, they would like to appreciate me as a kind person first. They remmember me as the one who remember everyone's birthdy, help them out bad situations and advocate for lending on the Kiva platform (a non-profit that provides microloans to people in need).

As for my weaknesses, the first thing I noticed is that we have different focus of concerns. They are not worrying about me not working hard, but working too much. My family members, particularly, think I don't spend enough time taking care of myself or with them. 

They also think I'm not social enough. Some mentioned that I appeared to be a bit cold or even arrogant when they saw me from a distance before being a friend of mine. My refusals of parties might also be misinterpreted as unfriendliness. From now on, I think I need join more group activities, in case that I miss some interesting people or information. I'm good at maintaining strong ties, but not at building weak ones.

Furthermore, they pointed out that I could be strict with others when they didn't do something as promised/expected. If I make up my mind, it's very hard, if not impossible, to change my ideas.

## My Feature-Benefit Model
As a conclusion, I think my top features that offer identifiable and distinguishable benifits to other people and the world are: well rounded, ambitious, reliable and charismatic. These features make me a good team player, or even a good leader (I still need improve my people skills).
