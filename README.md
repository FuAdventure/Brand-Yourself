# Branding Myself
![Me](https://github.com/FuAdventure/Brand-Yourself/blob/master/Me.PNG)

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign developing point-of-care diagnostic systems. Besides my study interests (bioinstrument, data science, business, etc.), I also have a wide range of hobbies, such as reading, traveling, playing flute, dancing and gardening. 

## Self-Analysis
I'm actually a fan of personality analysis and have completed many tests. For example, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), my personality type is ENTJ (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging), the Commander type. It's said that Commanders are natural-born leaders and contribute to about 2~3% of total population. (I'm honered to fall in the same category as Steve Jobs!) From self-analysis, I listed some of my top strengths and weaknesses.
##### Strength One: A fast and happy learner
I don't need emphasize on my love of learning since I have already been in school for so many years. I'm curious and would like to learn about so many things. In most cases, I can learn whatever that can be taught. I'd like to be a Renaissance person and Leonardo da Vinci is one of my idols.
##### Strength Two: Ambitious
I once encounted a quote from Arnold Beckman that engraved on the wall of the Beckman Institute on our campus, "There is no satisfactory substitute for excellence". I resonate with it very much. For me, the greatest happiness is from making achivements, not from entertainment. I guess I love learning partly because it makes me more powerful in solving problems and achieving my goals.
#### Strength Three:
