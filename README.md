![image](https://github.com/FuAdventure/Brand-Yourself/blob/master/Me.PNG)
I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign developing point-of-care diagnostic systems. Besides my study interests (bioinstrument, data science, business, etc.), I also have a wide range of hobbies, such as reading, traveling, playing flute, dancing and gardening.
